# RATE LAW
**Rate** is an application that helps engineers and scientists to study the rate of chemical reactions, focusing on only one reactant. 

### Theory
The rate of a chemical reaction refers to the speed at which a reaction proceeds. This reaction can be classified into several orders. The **order** of the reaction is the power to which the concentration of the reactant is raised in the rate law.


According to the **rate law**, the rate of a reaction is directly proportional to the concentration of the reactant raised to a certain power (order).

### Problem
Deriving an equation for different order of a reaction can be quite cumbersome. Hence, there is a need to create a simple tool that generates the solution to our resulting **ODE** from the rate law.

### Solution
This software provides a solution to the above problem. **Rate Application** utilizes a pattern deduced from the solution of the various homogenuous ordinary differential equations. 

### How To use The Application
1. Clone this repository to get the source code.
2. Make sure you have **g++ version 9.2.0** installed on your local machine.
3. From the directory where **main.cpp** compile the source code to get an execcutable file.
4. Run the executable file.

### Part II
1. Enter the values requested by the application.
**NOTE:** The app does not consider units so becareful with your inputs.
2. If the app prompts for your output filename make sure you append .csv as the file extension for easier data analysis.
